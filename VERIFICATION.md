## 🟠 HIGH Issues (Count: 14)

*Wrong calculations, missing features, poor performance*

### ISSUE-001 - HIGH - Missing Named Range
**Sheet:** Categories_DB  
**Issue Type:** Missing Feature  
**Location:** Named Range Definitions  

**Issue:** The spec defines `Active_Categories` using the FILTER function, which is not available in Excel 2016 (stated compatibility target). This will cause #NAME? errors on older Excel versions.

**Evidence:**
```excel
Active_Categories = FILTER(Categories_DB!$A$2:$A$1000, Categories_DB!$F$2:$F$1000="Active")
```

**Impact:**
- Breaks dropdown lists on Quick Entry, Budget, and other sheets
- Users on Excel 2016/2019 cannot use the workbook
- Critical functionality unavailable on target platform

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Use helper column approach (Excel 2016 compatible):
```excel
' Add hidden column H in Categories_DB with formula:
H2: =IF(F2="Active", A2, "")
' Then Active_Categories points to column H
Active_Categories = Categories_DB!$H$2:$H$1000
```

Option 2: Use dynamic array workaround for Excel 365 with fallback:
```excel
IF(ISFORMULA(FILTER(...)), FILTER(...), [Helper_Column_Range])
```

**Priority:** HIGH - Must fix before release

---

### ISSUE-002 - HIGH - Circular Reference in Formula
**Sheet:** Categories_DB  
**Issue Type:** Formula Error  
**Location:** Column G (Created Date)  

**Issue:** The specified auto-fill formula for Created date contains a circular reference:
```excel
G2: =IF(A2<>"", IF(G2="", TODAY(), G2), "")
```
This references G2 within G2's own formula, which Excel will flag as a circular reference error.

**Evidence:** Standard Excel behavior rejects circular references unless iterative calculation is enabled (not recommended for this use case)

**Impact:**
- Formula will not work as intended
- May trigger Excel warning dialog
- Created dates won't auto-populate
- Manual entry required (defeats purpose of automation)

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Use VBA (but project is 100% formula-driven, so NOT viable)

Option 2: Remove auto-fill formula entirely:
- Column G = manual entry or blank
- Accept that users must enter date when adding category
- Document this in user instructions

Option 3: Use a different trigger mechanism:
```excel
' In Settings sheet, create a "Last_Category_Added" timestamp
' When user adds category, they update that timestamp
' Then G2: =IF(AND(A2<>"", G2=""), Settings!Last_Category_Added, G2)
```
(Still has complexity, but avoids direct circular ref)

**Priority:** HIGH - Currently non-functional formula

---

### ISSUE-011 - HIGH - Circular Reference in Last_Updated Formula
**Sheet:** Settings_DB  
**Issue Type:** Formula Error  
**Location:** Column D (Last_Updated) - D2 formula  

**Issue:** The auto-update formula for Last_Updated contains an undefined reference:
```excel
D2: =IF(B2<>B2_Previous, NOW(), D2)
```
"B2_Previous" doesn't exist - this creates #NAME? or #REF! error.

**Evidence:** Same pattern as ISSUE-002 in Categories_DB - circular/undefined reference

**Impact:**
- Formula will not work as intended
- Last_Updated column cannot auto-track changes
- Manual updates required (defeats automation purpose)
- NOW() function makes sheet volatile (performance hit)

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Remove auto-update formula entirely
- Make Last_Updated manual entry
- Document: "Update this date when changing Setting_Value"
- Accept manual overhead

Option 2: Use VBA to track changes
- But project is 100% formula-driven, so NOT viable

Option 3: Use external trigger cell
- Create Settings!Z1 = NOW()
- User updates Z1 when making changes
- D2: =IF(B2<>"", Z1, "")
- Still manual but simpler

Option 4: Accept that Last_Updated is write-once
- D2: =IF(AND(A2<>"", D2=""), NOW(), D2)
- Only fills when row is first created
- Won't track subsequent updates

**Priority:** HIGH - Currently non-functional formula

---

### ISSUE-018 - HIGH - FILTER() Incompatibility (Active_Transactions)
**Sheet:** Transaction_DB  
**Issue Type:** Missing Named Range / Platform Compatibility  
**Location:** Named Range: Active_Transactions  

**Issue:** The spec defines Active_Transactions using FILTER(), which is not available in Excel 2016:
```excel
Active_Transactions = FILTER(Transaction_DB, Transaction_DB[Deleted?]=FALSE)
```

**Evidence:**
- Same issue as ISSUE-001 with Categories_DB
- FILTER() introduced in Excel 365
- Target platform: Excel 2016+

**Impact:**
- #NAME? error on Excel 2016/2019
- Quick Entry Recent Transactions table breaks (uses Active_Transactions)
- Dashboard, Budget, Debt sheets cannot filter deleted transactions
- Critical functionality unavailable on target platform

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Use helper column in Transaction_DB
```excel
' Add column M with formula:
M2: =IF(K2=FALSE, ROW(), "")
' Then:
Active_Transactions = Transaction_DB!$M$2:$M$10000
' Filter formulas become:
=INDEX(Transaction_DB[Date], MATCH(ROW()-52, Active_Transactions, 0))
```

Option 2: Use array formula (Excel 2016 compatible)
```excel
' In Quick Entry recent transactions:
=IFERROR(INDEX(Transaction_DB[Date],
               SMALL(IF(Transaction_DB[Deleted?]=FALSE, ROW(Transaction_DB)-1), ROW()-52)),
         "")
' Enter with Ctrl+Shift+Enter
```

**Priority:** HIGH - Breaks core functionality

---

### ISSUE-019 - HIGH - Volatile Functions in Database
**Sheet:** Transaction_DB  
**Issue Type:** Performance Issue  
**Location:** Columns J (Timestamp) and L (ID)  

**Issue:** Database uses volatile functions that recalculate constantly:
```excel
J2 (Timestamp): =NOW()
L2 (ID): =TEXT(RAND()*1E15,"0")
```

With 10,000 row pre-allocation, this creates 20,000 volatile cells.

**Evidence:**
- NOW() and RAND() are volatile (recalculate on ANY workbook change)
- Spec allocates rows 2-10001 (10,000 rows)
- 10,000 * 2 volatile formulas = 20,000 recalculations per edit
- Excel slows down significantly with >1,000 volatile formulas

**Impact:**
- **Severe:** Workbook becomes sluggish with every keystroke
- **Exponential:** Gets worse as user adds more transactions
- **User experience:** Typing lag, save delays, formula calculation pauses
- **Scale:** At 1,000 transactions, already 2,000 volatile cells (Excel's practical limit)

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Remove formulas from database entirely (RECOMMENDED)
- Transaction_DB is pure data storage (no formulas)
- Quick Entry appends values (not formulas) using VBA or manual paste
- Timestamp populated when Quick Entry saves (one-time value)
- ID generated once using UUID library or GUID function

Option 2: Use non-volatile alternatives
```excel
' For Timestamp: Use trigger-based formula
J2: =IF(A2<>"", IF(J2="", Quick_Entry!Z4, J2), "")
' Fills once from Quick Entry timestamp, then persists

' For ID: Use incremental counter
L2: =IF(A2<>"", "TXN"&TEXT(ROW(),"00000"), "")
' Simple sequential ID: TXN00001, TXN00002, etc.
```

Option 3: Accept volatility but reduce allocation
- Pre-allocate only 1,000 rows instead of 10,000
- Expand manually as needed
- Still problematic but more manageable

**Priority:** HIGH - Critical performance bottleneck

---

### ISSUE-020 - HIGH - Append Formula Architecture Impossible
**Sheet:** Transaction_DB + Quick Entry  
**Issue Type:** Formula Error / Circular Reference  
**Location:** Transaction_DB!A2 (append formula)  

**Issue:** Spec describes Transaction_DB having formulas that read Quick Entry and append transactions:
```excel
' In Transaction_DB!A2:
=IF('Quick Entry'!Z3,  /* Trigger detected */
   {'Quick Entry'!QE_Date, ...},  /* Append data */
   "")
```

But Quick Entry also has formulas that read Transaction_DB:
```excel
' In Quick Entry Recent Transactions table:
=FILTER(Transaction_DB, Transaction_DB[Deleted?]=FALSE)
```

This creates a circular dependency: Transaction_DB → Quick Entry → Transaction_DB

**Evidence:**
- Spec Section "Append to Transaction_DB" shows formulas in A2
- Spec Section "Recent Transactions Table" shows formulas reading Transaction_DB
- Excel will detect circular reference and either:
  - Block the formula (error)
  - Enable iterative calculation (incorrect results, slow)

**Impact:**
- **Critical:** Cannot implement as specified
- **Blocking:** Prevents Phase 2 completion
- **Architecture flaw:** Database sheets should never contain formulas that depend on user sheets

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Database is pure data (RECOMMENDED)
- Transaction_DB contains NO formulas (except Month_ID column)
- Quick Entry uses VBA or manual append to add rows
- OR user copies form data and pastes into Transaction_DB
- Recent Transactions table reads static data from Transaction_DB

Option 2: Use intermediate staging sheet
- Quick Entry saves to QE_Staging (1 row)
- Transaction_DB formulas read QE_Staging (not Quick Entry)
- QE_Staging clears after append
- Breaks circular reference

Option 3: Accept manual data entry
- Quick Entry is just a formatted input area
- User manually copies data to Transaction_DB
- No automation, but 100% formula-driven

**Priority:** HIGH - Spec is unimplementable as written

---

### ISSUE-025 - HIGH - Quick Entry Circular Dependency (Duplicate)
**Sheet:** Quick Entry  
**Issue Type:** Formula Error / Circular Reference  
**Location:** Entire sheet architecture  

**Issue:** This is the same circular dependency as ISSUE-020, viewed from Quick Entry side:
- Quick Entry Recent Transactions (rows 53-102) read Transaction_DB
- Transaction_DB formulas read Quick Entry trigger (Z3)
- Creates: Quick Entry → Transaction_DB → Quick Entry

**Evidence:** See ISSUE-020 for full analysis

**Impact:** Cannot implement Quick Entry as specified

**Recommendation:** See ISSUE-020 solutions - most viable is making Transaction_DB pure data (no formulas)

**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks Phase 2 completion

---

### ISSUE-033 - HIGH - Missing CSV Template/Column Headers
**Sheet:** CSV Import  
**Issue Type:** Missing Feature / Documentation Gap  
**Location:** Paste area / Instructions  

**Issue:** The CSV Import sheet does not provide column headers or a template showing users how to organize their bank data before pasting.

**Evidence:**
- Spec shows normalization formulas (Date, Amount, Type, Description)
- No mention of header row: "Date | Amount | Description" or similar
- User must guess: Which column for date? Which for amount?
- Different banks export CSVs with different column orders
- No visual guide or example of correct format

**Impact:**
- User confusion: "Do I paste dates in column A or B?"
- Import failures: User pastes in wrong order, normalization breaks
- Support burden: Users will need help formatting CSV correctly
- Data quality: Incorrect pastes lead to wrong categorization

**Recommendation:**
Add header row above paste area:
```
Row 8 (Headers - never cleared):
A8: Date (MM/DD/YYYY)
B8: Description  
C8: Amount ($-100.50)
D8: [Optional] Account
```

**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks usability

---

### ISSUE-034 - HIGH - No CSV Data Clearing After Import
**Sheet:** CSV Import  
**Issue Type:** Missing Feature  
**Location:** Import workflow  

**Issue:** After user imports CSV data to Transaction_DB, the pasted CSV data remains in CSV Import sheet. No auto-clear or manual clear button specified.

**Evidence:**
From formula patterns: CSV Import → Normalize → Preview → Import Selected
But no step shows: "Clear CSV data after import"

**Impact:**
- Data duplication risk: User might import same data twice
- Confusion: "Did my data already import? Should I re-import?"
- Privacy: Sensitive transaction data visible until manually deleted
- File size: Old CSV data accumulates, increases file size

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Auto-clear after import (RECOMMENDED)
Option 2: Manual clear button  
Option 3: Both - Auto-clear + manual option

**Priority:** HIGH - Data integrity and usability issue

---

### ISSUE-035 - HIGH - 10K Row Pre-Allocation Performance (CSV Import)
**Sheet:** CSV Import  
**Issue Type:** Performance Issue  
**Location:** Normalization formulas / Preview table  

**Issue:** If CSV Import uses same 10K row pre-allocation as Transaction_DB, normalization formulas will cause severe performance issues during paste operations.

**Evidence:**
- Transaction_DB has 10K row performance issue (ISSUE-023)
- CSV Import likely has similar formulas running for each row
- With 1000 rows pasted: 1000 rows * 5 formulas * 10K Transaction scans = 5M calculations
- Excel will freeze during large CSV imports

**Impact:**
- Severe: Workbook freezes when user pastes 100+ transactions
- User frustration: "Why is Excel not responding?"
- Data loss: User might force-quit during freeze, losing work
- Limits usability: Can't import full bank statements (300-500 rows typical)

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Limit CSV Import to 500 rows max
Option 2: Use helper columns (non-volatile formulas)
Option 3: Progressive loading (formulas run only on demand)

**Priority:** HIGH - Performance bottleneck for core feature

---

### ISSUE-041 - HIGH - Button Functionality Unimplementable
**Sheet:** Settings Sheet  
**Issue Type:** Missing Implementation / Architecture Flaw  
**Location:** All button elements (7+ buttons)  

**Issue:** Spec shows multiple clickable buttons but provides no formula-only implementation strategy:
- [💾 Save Locale Settings] (A9)
- [➕ Add New Category] (A47)
- [💾 Save Category] (A56)
- [Rename] / [Delete] links for each category
- [🗑️ Delete Sample Data] (A79)
- [🔄 Reset & Start Fresh] (A85)
- [📦 Archive Old Transactions] (A90)
- [📥 Export to CSV] (A92)

**Evidence:**
- Same issue as Quick Entry ISSUE-026
- Project is 100% formula-driven (no VBA)
- Excel formulas cannot detect button clicks
- Spec provides no Save Cell pattern for these actions

**Impact:**
- **Critical:** Settings sheet cannot function as specified
- **Blocking:** No way to save currency/date changes
- **Blocking:** Cannot add/edit/delete categories
- **User confusion:** Buttons that don't work

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Use Save Cell pattern (like Quick Entry)
```
Row 9: User types value in B9, press Enter triggers save
Z9 detects change, updates Settings_DB
```

Option 2: Make Settings sheet read-only display
- User edits Settings_DB directly (unhide sheet)
- Settings sheet just shows current values
- No buttons, just display

Option 3: Accept VBA for button handlers
- Violates formula-only requirement

**Priority:** HIGH - Core functionality blocked

---

### ISSUE-042 - HIGH - Category CRUD Operations Missing Implementation
**Sheet:** Settings Sheet  
**Issue Type:** Missing Implementation / Circular Dependency  
**Location:** Category Management section (rows 17-75)  

**Issue:** Spec shows Add/Rename/Delete operations for categories but provides no formula implementation:

**Add Category Flow:**
1. User clicks [➕ Add New Category] → How? (no VBA)
2. Form expands (A51-B57) → How expand/collapse with formulas?
3. User fills Name, Type, Color, Icon → Input cells
4. Clicks [💾 Save Category] → How trigger? (no VBA)
5. New row added to Categories_DB → How append with formulas?

**Delete Category Flow:**
1. User clicks [Delete] link → How? (no VBA)
2. Confirmation shows transaction count → OK (COUNTIF formula)
3. User types DELETE → Validation cell
4. Clicks [Yes, Delete] → How trigger?
5. Category Status changed to "Archived" → How update?

**Evidence:**
- No formulas provided for category CRUD
- Circular dependency: Settings reads Categories_DB[Name], writes to Categories_DB[Status]
- Same architecture problem as ISSUE-020 (Transaction_DB)

**Impact:**
- **Critical:** Category management completely non-functional
- **Blocking:** Users cannot add custom categories
- **Blocking:** Cannot delete unused categories

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Categories_DB is append-only
- Add Category: User manually adds row to Categories_DB
- Delete Category: User changes Status to "Archived"
- Settings sheet shows read-only list

Option 2: Use Save Cell pattern
```
A51-B54: Input cells (Name, Type, Color, Icon)
B56: Save cell (user types YES to confirm)
Z56: Trigger detection
- Finds next empty row in Categories_DB
- Writes values
- Clears input cells
```

**Priority:** HIGH - Core feature unimplementable

---

### ISSUE-043 - HIGH - Archive_DB Sheet Doesn't Exist
**Sheet:** Settings Sheet  
**Issue Type:** Missing Feature / Spec Inconsistency  
**Location:** A90 [📦 Archive Old Transactions] button  

**Issue:** Spec mentions archiving old transactions to "Archive_DB" but this sheet doesn't exist:
- 01_Master_Index.md lists 19 sheets total
- No Archive_DB in the list
- Archive feature references non-existent sheet

**Evidence:**
19-sheet structure (from 01_Master_Index.md):
- 9 User sheets: Instructions, Settings, Income, Budget, Dashboard, Quick Entry, Debt, Net Worth, CSV Import
- 10 DB sheets: Transaction, Debt, Debt_Payments, NetWorth_Snapshots, Budget_Allocations, Goals, Income_Sources, Income_Plan_History, Categories, Settings, Keywords

No Archive_DB anywhere.

**Impact:**
- **Feature impossible:** Cannot archive transactions
- **Spec inconsistency:** References non-existent sheet
- **Performance:** No way to reduce file size as promised

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Add Archive_DB to structure
- Phase 3 creates Archive_DB (same schema as Transaction_DB)
- Archive button moves rows where Date < 1 year ago
- Update 01_Master_Index to show 20 sheets

Option 2: Remove archive feature
- Delete archive button from Settings sheet
- Remove from spec entirely
- Users manually delete old transactions if needed

Option 3: Soft delete old transactions
- Add Archived column to Transaction_DB
- Archive sets Archived=TRUE instead of moving
- Dashboard filters out archived transactions

**Priority:** HIGH - Feature references non-existent sheet

---

### ISSUE-044 - HIGH - Export to CSV Impossible Without VBA
**Sheet:** Settings Sheet  
**Issue Type:** Missing Implementation / Platform Limitation  
**Location:** A92 [📥 Export to CSV] button  

**Issue:** Excel formulas cannot create or download files. Export to CSV requires either:
- VBA: `Workbook.SaveAs "file.csv", xlCSV`
- Manual: User copies data and pastes into text editor
- Add-in: Third-party tool with file I/O permissions

**Evidence:**
- Excel formula functions have no file I/O capabilities
- Cannot create files, write to disk, or trigger downloads
- Project constraint: 100% formula-driven (no VBA)

**Impact:**
- **Feature impossible:** Cannot export as specified
- **User expectation:** Button implies one-click export
- **Workaround needed:** Manual copy-paste process

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Remove export button
- Delete from Settings sheet
- Update spec to remove feature

Option 2: Change to "Prepare for Export"
```
Button creates new sheet "Export_Prep" with:
- All Transaction_DB data
- Formatted as CSV-ready (no formulas)
- Instructions: "Copy this sheet and paste into Excel, then Save As CSV"
```

Option 3: Accept VBA for export
```vba
Sub ExportToCSV()
    ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs "transactions.csv", xlCSV
End Sub
```
Violates formula-only requirement

Option 4: Document manual process
```
Instructions:
1. Go to Transaction_DB sheet
2. Select all data (Ctrl+A)
3. Copy (Ctrl+C)
4. Open Notepad
5. Paste (Ctrl+V)
6. Save As → transactions.csv
```

**Priority:** HIGH - Feature unimplementable as specified

---

### ISSUE-094 - HIGH - Database Location Unspecified
**Sheet:** Debt_DB  
**Issue Type:** Missing Specification  
**Location:** Entire sheet placement  

**Issue:** Phase 6 spec says Debt_DB is "hidden" but doesn't specify WHERE it lives:
- Is it embedded in Settings_DB (like other DBs in Phase 1)?
- Is it a separate sheet?
- What row range should be allocated?

**Evidence:**
- Phase 1 databases (Categories, Settings, Keywords) are in Settings_DB at specific rows
- Phase 2 Transaction_DB is a separate sheet
- Phase 6 doesn't clarify this for Debt_DB

**Impact:**
- Implementation uncertainty
- Row allocation conflicts possible
- Can't create named ranges without knowing location

**Recommendation:**
Create Debt_DB as separate hidden sheet (following Transaction_DB pattern) at rows 2-51 (50 debt capacity).

**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks implementation

---

### ISSUE-096 - HIGH - Curr_Bal Circular Dependency
**Sheet:** Debt_DB  
**Issue Type:** Formula Error / Circular Reference  
**Location:** Column E (Curr_Bal)  

**Issue:** Curr_Bal formula reads from Debt_Payments_DB:
```excel
E2: =D2 - SUMIFS(Debt_Payments_DB[Amount], 
                  Debt_Payments_DB[Debt_ID], 
                  A2)
```

But Debt sheet also WRITES to Debt_DB (Edit Debt, Add Debt forms), creating circular dependency:
- Debt_DB → reads Debt_Payments_DB
- Debt_Payments_DB → written by Quick Entry
- Quick Entry → reads Debt_DB (for debt dropdown)
- Creates: Debt_DB → Debt_Payments_DB → Quick Entry → Debt_DB

**Evidence:**
- Same architecture issue as ISSUE-020 (Transaction_DB circular ref)
- Database sheets should not contain formulas that depend on user sheets

**Impact:**
- **Critical architecture flaw**: Cannot implement as specified
- **Excel error**: Will detect circular reference
- **Blocks Phase 6 completion**

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Remove Curr_Bal formula (RECOMMENDED)
- Curr_Bal = manual value updated when payment recorded
- Quick Entry updates both: Debt_Payments_DB (append) AND Debt_DB[Curr_Bal] (subtract amount)
- Dual-write pattern (same as Transaction_DB solution)

Option 2: Use helper column
- Move SUMIFS to hidden column in Debt sheet
- Debt_DB[Curr_Bal] = static value
- Debt sheet displays calculated balance

**Priority:** HIGH - Critical architecture flaw

---

### ISSUE-097 - HIGH - Active_Debts Uses FILTER (Excel 365 Only)
**Sheet:** Debt_DB  
**Issue Type:** Platform Compatibility  
**Location:** Named Range: Active_Debts  

**Issue:** Spec implies Active_Debts uses FILTER():
```excel
Active_Debts = FILTER(Debt_DB, Debt_DB[Status]="Active")
```

FILTER() not available in Excel 2016 (stated compatibility target).

**Evidence:**
- Same issue as ISSUE-001 (Categories_DB), ISSUE-018 (Transaction_DB)
- Pattern repeats across all database sheets
- Project targets Excel 2016+ but uses Excel 365 functions

**Impact:**
- #NAME? error on Excel 2016/2019
- Debt sheet table breaks
- Dashboard debt charts break
- Critical functionality unavailable on target platform

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Use helper column (Excel 2016 compatible)
```excel
' Add column L with formula:
L2: =IF(I2="Active", ROW(), "")
' Then:
Active_Debts = Debt_DB!$L$2:$L$51
```

Option 2: Accept Excel 365 requirement
- Update project scope to "Excel 365 only"
- Remove Excel 2016 compatibility

**Priority:** HIGH - Breaks core functionality

---

### ISSUE-103 - HIGH - Dual-Write Architecture Complexity
**Sheet:** Debt_DB + Debt_Payments_DB  
**Issue Type:** Architecture Design  
**Location:** Quick Entry integration  

**Issue:** When user pays debt via Quick Entry, system must write to THREE places:
1. Transaction_DB (expense record)
2. Debt_Payments_DB (payment log)
3. Debt_DB[Curr_Bal] (update balance) - IF Curr_Bal is manual

This triple-write is complex and error-prone.

**Evidence:**
Phase 6 spec shows "Pay Debt Dual-Write" but doesn't address Curr_Bal update.

**Impact:**
- **Implementation complexity**: Three updates must happen atomically
- **Error risk**: If one fails, data inconsistent
- **Formula-only challenge**: Hard to coordinate without VBA

**Recommendation:**
Accept Curr_Bal as calculated field (ISSUE-096 solution Option 2):
```excel
' In Debt sheet (not Debt_DB):
Calculated_Balance: =Orig_Bal - SUMIFS(Debt_Payments_DB[Amount], ...)
```

Then dual-write only to:
1. Transaction_DB
2. Debt_Payments_DB

Debt_DB[Curr_Bal] column removed or used for display only.

**Priority:** HIGH - Architecture simplification needed

---

### ISSUE-104 - HIGH - Database Location Unspecified
**Sheet:** Debt_Payments_DB  
**Issue Type:** Missing Specification  
**Location:** Entire sheet placement  

**Issue:** Phase 6 spec says Debt_Payments_DB is "hidden" but doesn't specify WHERE:
- Separate sheet? (like Transaction_DB)
- Row range? (500 rows mentioned in named ranges)
- Hidden by default?

**Evidence:**
- Named ranges reference $D$2:$D$500 (implies rows 2-500)
- No explicit sheet creation instruction
- Same issue as Debt_DB (ISSUE-094)

**Impact:**
- Implementation uncertainty
- Can't create sheet without knowing location

**Recommendation:**
Create Debt_Payments_DB as separate hidden sheet at rows 2-501 (500 payment capacity).

**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks implementation

---

### ISSUE-108 - HIGH - Foreign Key Validation Missing
**Sheet:** Debt_Payments_DB  
**Issue Type:** Data Integrity / Missing Feature  
**Location:** Column B (Debt_ID)  

**Issue:** Debt_ID column should validate that the ID exists in Debt_DB[ID], but no validation specified.

**Evidence:**
```excel
' Expected validation:
Column B: Data Validation
  List: =Debt_DB[ID]
  Error: "Debt ID must exist in Debt_DB"
```

But spec shows no validation.

**Impact:**
- **Critical data integrity**: User could enter invalid Debt_ID
- **Orphaned payments**: Payment references non-existent debt
- **Balance calculation breaks**: SUMIFS won't find payments for that debt
- **Reports incorrect**: Payment history shows wrong debt or no debt

**Recommendation:**
Add dropdown validation:
```excel
Column B: List = Debt_DB[ID]
Input Message: "Select debt from list"
Error Alert: "Invalid Debt ID"
```

**Priority:** HIGH - Critical foreign key integrity

---

### ISSUE-109 - HIGH - Transaction_ID Linkage Undefined
**Sheet:** Debt_Payments_DB  
**Issue Type:** Missing Specification / Integration Issue  
**Location:** Column G (Transaction_ID)  

**Issue:** Transaction_ID column links to Transaction_DB but implementation undefined:
- Is this auto-populated when Quick Entry creates payment?
- Manual entry?
- How does system ensure linkage consistency?

**Evidence:**
Phase 6 spec shows "Pay Debt Dual-Write" creates both:
1. Transaction_DB entry → Gets ID
2. Debt_Payments_DB entry → Should store that ID

But mechanism not detailed:
```excel
' How does Debt_Payments_DB get Transaction_ID?
' Option 1: Quick Entry writes ID to both sheets
' Option 2: Formula looks up most recent Transaction_DB entry
' Option 3: Manual copy-paste
```

**Impact:**
- **Data integrity**: Payments and transactions not properly linked
- **Audit trail broken**: Can't trace payment to transaction
- **Reconciliation impossible**: Can't verify payment in Transaction_DB
- **Delete cascade fails**: If transaction deleted, payment orphaned

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Quick Entry dual-write (RECOMMENDED)
```
Quick Entry saves payment:
1. Generate Transaction_ID = "TXN"&ROW
2. Append to Transaction_DB with that ID
3. Append to Debt_Payments_DB with same ID in column G
```

Option 2: Validation rule
```excel
Column G: Data Validation
  Custom: =COUNTIF(Transaction_DB[ID], G2) > 0
  Error: "Transaction ID must exist"
```

**Priority:** HIGH - Critical linkage integrity

---

### ISSUE-114 - HIGH - Button Functionality Unimplementable
**Sheet:** Debt Sheet  
**Issue Type:** Missing Implementation / Architecture Flaw  
**Location:** Multiple button elements  

**Issue:** Spec shows clickable buttons with no formula-only implementation:
- **Row 12-25**: [Pay] [Edit] [Delete] links for each debt
- **Row 56**: [📊 Calculate Scenarios] button

Same issue as Quick Entry (ISSUE-026), Settings (ISSUE-041).

**Evidence:**
```
A12-F25: Debt table with action buttons
A56: [📊 Calculate Scenarios] button (44px height, Navy bg)
```

Project is 100% formula-driven (no VBA).

**Impact:**
- **Critical**: Cannot implement action buttons as specified
- **Blocking**: Pay/Edit/Delete functionality impossible
- **User confusion**: Buttons that don't work

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Use Save Cell pattern
```
Row actions trigger via cell changes:
- User types "PAY" in action cell
- Z-column detects change
- Updates Debt_DB or opens Quick Entry
```

Option 2: Remove buttons, direct user to Quick Entry
```
"To pay debt: Use Quick Entry → Pay Debt form"
"To edit debt: Modify Debt_DB directly"
```

**Priority:** HIGH - Core functionality blocked

### ISSUE-115 - HIGH - Edit/Delete Debt CRUD Operations Missing
**Sheet:** Debt Sheet  
**Issue Type:** Missing Implementation  
**Location:** Row 12-25 action buttons  

**Issue:** [Edit] and [Delete] buttons shown but implementation undefined:

**Edit Flow:**
1. User clicks [Edit] → How? (no VBA)
2. Form expands or navigates somewhere → Where?
3. User changes APR/Min_Pay/etc → In what cells?
4. Saves changes → How trigger?
5. Debt_DB updates → How write?

**Delete Flow:**
1. User clicks [Delete] → How?
2. Confirmation prompt → How display without VBA?
3. Status changes to "Archived" → How trigger?

**Evidence:**
Spec shows buttons but zero implementation detail.

**Impact:**
- **Critical**: Cannot edit debts after creation
- **Blocking**: Cannot archive paid-off debts
- **User frustration**: Core features don't work

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Direct editing in Debt_DB
```
"To edit debt details, go to Debt_DB sheet and modify values directly"
```

Option 2: Use forms in dedicated area
```
Row 30-40: Edit Debt form (similar to Quick Entry)
User types Debt_ID to edit, changes values, press Save Cell
```

**Priority:** HIGH - Critical CRUD operations missing

---

### ISSUE-116 - HIGH - Strategy Comparison Calculations Not Specified
**Sheet:** Debt Sheet  
**Issue Type:** Missing Formula Specification  
**Location:** Rows 27-50 strategy cards  

**Issue:** Strategy comparison shows results but formulas undefined:

**Snowball Card (A29-E50):**
- "Months to Debt-Free: 34" → Formula?
- "Total Interest: $5,800" → Formula?
- "First Payoff: Credit Card B (11mo)" → Formula?

**Avalanche Card (G29-K50):**
- "Months to Debt-Free: 32" → Formula?
- "Total Interest: $5,200" → Formula?
- "First Payoff: Credit Card A (18mo)" → Formula?

**Evidence:**
Phase 6 shows formulas for:
- Weighted APR ✓
- Debt-Free ETA (NPER) ✓
- Payoff order (SORT) ✓

But NOT for:
- Months to debt-free PER STRATEGY
- Total interest PER STRATEGY
- First payoff timing PER STRATEGY

**Impact:**
- **Implementation blocked**: Can't build strategy comparison without formulas
- **Complex calculations**: Need to simulate payment schedules
- **High effort**: Requires month-by-month calculation

**Recommendation:**
Provide detailed formulas:
```excel
' Snowball strategy (smallest balance first)
Snowball_Order = SORT(Active_Debts, [Curr_Bal], 1)
Snowball_Months = SUM of NPER calculations per debt
Snowball_Interest = (Snowball_Months * Avg_Monthly_Interest) - Total_Paid

' Avalanche strategy (highest APR first)
Avalanche_Order = SORT(Active_Debts, [APR], -1)
Avalanche_Months = SUM of NPER calculations per debt
Avalanche_Interest = (Avalanche_Months * Avg_Monthly_Interest) - Total_Paid
```

**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks strategy comparison feature

---

### ISSUE-119 - HIGH - Calculate Scenarios Button Trigger Mechanism
**Sheet:** Debt Sheet  
**Issue Type:** Missing Implementation  
**Location:** A56 button  

**Issue:** [📊 Calculate Scenarios] button must trigger formula recalculation, but mechanism undefined.

**Expected Flow:**
1. User changes strategy or extra payment amount
2. User clicks [Calculate Scenarios]
3. All scenario formulas recalculate
4. Charts update

**Problem:**
- Formulas auto-calculate in Excel (don't need button trigger)
- If button is just visual, why have it?
- If it actually does something, what and how?

**Evidence:**
Acceptance Test #16 says "Click [Calculate]" and "Results recalculate instantly".

**Impact:**
- **Confusion**: Button purpose unclear
- **Implementation uncertainty**: What does button actually do?

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Remove button entirely
```
Formulas auto-calculate when strategy/amount changes
No button needed
```

Option 2: Make button informational
```
A56: "Results update automatically when you change settings above"
No button, just text
```

Option 3: Use button as Save Cell
```
A56: User types "CALC" to force manual recalc
Z56: Detects change, toggles recalc flag
```

**Priority:** HIGH - Button purpose undefined

---

### ISSUE-049 - HIGH - Instructions Sheet Specifications Completely Missing
**Sheet:** Instructions Sheet  
**Issue Type:** Missing Documentation / Critical Gap  
**Location:** Phase_03_Utilities.md - Instructions section  

**Issue:** The Phase 3 document shows "*(CSV Import and Instructions sections remain unchanged...)*" but provides NO specifications for the Instructions Sheet. Only basic coordinates exist in Master Index.

**Impact:** Cannot implement Instructions Sheet without detailed specifications. This is the first sheet users see for onboarding.

**Recommendation:** Add complete specification including layout, content outline (video tour, quick start guide, 15 FAQs), visual design, column widths, and acceptance tests.

**Priority:** HIGH - Blocking Instructions Sheet implementation

## 🟡 MEDIUM Issues (Count: 30)

*UX issues, non-optimal formulas, minor bugs*

### ISSUE-003 - MEDIUM - Incorrect Terminology
**Sheet:** Categories_DB  
**Issue Type:** Design Mismatch  
**Location:** Schema Documentation  

**Issue:** Specification uses SQL database terminology "Indexes" which doesn't apply to Excel:
```
Indexes:
- Primary: Name (unique)
- Filter: Status="Active"
```

Excel doesn't have "indexes" in the database sense. This creates confusion.

**Impact:**
- Confusing for implementer (what does "create index" mean in Excel?)
- No actual performance benefit (Excel doesn't use indexes)
- Documentation mismatch with reality

**Recommendation:**
Replace with Excel-appropriate language:
```
Constraints:
- Name: Must be unique (use Data Validation with COUNTIF)
- Status: Must be "Active" or "Archived" (dropdown validation)

Performance Notes:
- Named ranges cached by Excel for fast lookup
- FILTER/helper column approach for Active_Categories
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Doesn't break functionality but causes confusion

---

### ISSUE-004 - MEDIUM - Icon Column Purpose Unclear
**Sheet:** Categories_DB  
**Issue Type:** UX Problem  
**Location:** Column D (Icon)  

**Issue:** Specification says "Icon" column stores "Text label, not emoji" with example "Housing". This is redundant with the Name column and the reason for avoiding emoji is not explained.

**Evidence:**
- Name column: "Housing"
- Icon column: "Housing" → Same value, no added information
- Note says "not emoji" but doesn't explain why

**Impact:**
- Wasted column (30 bytes per category * 30 categories)
- User confusion (why enter same value twice?)
- If emoji were intended, current spec blocks them without explanation

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Remove Icon column entirely
- Categories_DB becomes A-F (6 columns)
- Remove from all specs and sheet layouts
- Use Name for display everywhere

Option 2: Clarify Icon purpose and allow emoji:
- Icon = Short display label (1-2 chars or emoji)
- Examples: 🏠 (Housing), 🛒 (Groceries), 🍽️ (Dining)
- Add note: "Emoji rendering may vary across platforms"
- Use Icon in compact UIs (mobile view, chart legends)

Option 3: Make Icon functional:
- Icon = Category code/abbreviation (e.g., "HSG", "GRC", "DIN")
- Used in formulas or exports where short code needed

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Not broken but suboptimal design

---

### ISSUE-005 - MEDIUM - Missing Category Type
**Sheet:** Categories_DB  
**Issue Type:** Missing Feature  
**Location:** Column B (Type) validation list  

**Issue:** Sample data includes "Needs" and "Wants" categories (for 50/30/20 budget method) but the Type validation only allows: Income/Expense/Savings/Transfer.

Where do "Needs" and "Wants" fit? The 50/30/20 method requires distinguishing these.

**Evidence:**
From Phase_05_Budget_System.md:
```
50/30/20 Method:
Needs_Budget = Monthly_Income * 0.50 / COUNT(Needs_Categories)
Wants_Budget = Monthly_Income * 0.30 / COUNT(Wants_Categories)
```

But Categories_DB Type column can't store "Needs" or "Wants".

**Impact:**
- Budget 50/30/20 method cannot function as designed
- No way to classify Housing as "Needs" vs Entertainment as "Wants"
- Critical feature (main budget method) is broken

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Expand Type validation list:
```
Type options: Income | Needs | Wants | Savings | Transfer
```
Then map in Budget sheet:
- Needs → 50% allocation
- Wants → 30% allocation  
- Savings → 20% allocation

Option 2: Add separate column "Budget_Type":
- Type: Income/Expense/Savings/Transfer (transaction type)
- Budget_Type: Needs/Wants/Savings (budget allocation)
- Expense categories have both fields populated

Option 3: Use Tags/Labels system:
- Add column for tags (multi-select: Needs, Wants, etc.)
- More flexible for future enhancements

**Priority:** MEDIUM (would be HIGH but workaround exists: hardcode category names in Budget formulas)

---

### ISSUE-012 - MEDIUM - Data_Type Column Unused
**Sheet:** Settings_DB  
**Issue Type:** Design Inefficiency  
**Location:** Column C (Data_Type)  

**Issue:** Column C stores data type metadata ("String", "Number", "Boolean", "Date") but no formula, validation rule, or sheet references this column.

**Evidence:**
- No formula uses Settings_DB[Data_Type]
- No conditional formatting based on data type
- No validation rules that check data type
- Pure metadata with no functional purpose

**Impact:**
- **Minor:** Wastes 1 column width (~80px, 20 bytes per setting)
- **Minimal:** No performance impact (20 rows only)
- **Confusion:** Why does this column exist if unused?

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Remove column entirely
- Settings_DB becomes A-B-D (3 columns)
- Cleaner, simpler schema
- Update all specs/docs

Option 2: Make it functional
- Use Data_Type for input validation:
  ```excel
  =IF(Data_Type="Number", ISNUMBER(Setting_Value), TRUE)
  ```
- Add conditional formatting: color-code by type
- Show type hints in Settings sheet UI

Option 3: Keep for documentation
- Accept minor overhead
- Useful for developer reference
- Document: "Informational only"

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Not broken but suboptimal

---

### ISSUE-013 - MEDIUM - Week_Start Settings Redundant
**Sheet:** Settings_DB  
**Issue Type:** Design Mismatch  
**Location:** Rows 4-5 (Week_Start and Week_Start_Offset)  

**Issue:** Two settings define week start behavior:
```
Week_Start        | Sunday | String
Week_Start_Offset | 1      | Number
```
Spec doesn't clarify relationship or which takes precedence.

**Evidence:**
- Week_Start = "Sunday" (text)
- Week_Start_Offset = 1 (number)
- Is offset 0=Sunday/1=Monday? Or 1-7 where Sunday=1?
- If "Sunday" is set, why is offset needed?

**Impact:**
- **Confusion:** Two sources of truth for same config
- **Implementation risk:** Developer might use wrong setting
- **Inconsistency:** If user changes Week_Start to "Monday", should offset auto-update to 2?

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Use offset only (Excel standard)
```
Week_Start_Offset | 1 | Number (1=Sunday...7=Saturday)
```
Remove Week_Start text setting. More portable.

Option 2: Use text only
```
Week_Start | Sunday | String (dropdown: Sunday/Monday)
```
Remove offset. More user-friendly.

Option 3: Clarify relationship
- Week_Start = User-facing display ("Sunday")
- Week_Start_Offset = Formula input (1)
- Add formula: `=MATCH(Week_Start, {"Sunday","Monday",...}, 0)`
- Document in spec: "Offset auto-calculated from text setting"

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Functional but confusing

---

### ISSUE-014 - MEDIUM - Setup Flow State Machine Undefined
**Sheet:** Settings_DB  
**Issue Type:** Missing Documentation  
**Location:** Rows 10-15 (Setup/Onboarding settings)  

**Issue:** 6 settings related to setup/onboarding with no state diagram:
```
Setup_Complete    | FALSE | Boolean
Setup_Step_1      | FALSE | Boolean
Setup_Step_2      | FALSE | Boolean
Setup_Step_3      | FALSE | Boolean
Onboarding_State  | S0    | String
Banner_Dismissed  | FALSE | Boolean
Dismiss_Forever   | FALSE | Boolean
```

No explanation of:
- What each step represents
- When does S0 → S1 → S2 transition happen?
- Relationship between Setup_Step_X and Onboarding_State
- What triggers Setup_Complete=TRUE?

**Evidence:** Spec mentions these settings but provides no flow logic

**Impact:**
- **Developer confusion:** How to implement setup wizard?
- **Inconsistent behavior:** Different interpretations possible
- **Maintenance risk:** Future devs won't understand state machine
- **Testing gaps:** Can't test without knowing expected flow

**Recommendation:**
Add to spec:
```markdown
## Setup Flow State Machine

States:
- S0: Not started → Show welcome banner
- S1: Step 1 complete (currency/locale) → Show Step 2
- S2: Step 2 complete (income/budget) → Show Step 3  
- S3: Step 3 complete (categories) → Setup_Complete=TRUE

Transitions:
- S0→S1: User sets Currency_Symbol + Date_Format → Setup_Step_1=TRUE
- S1→S2: User sets Monthly_Income + Budget_Method → Setup_Step_2=TRUE
- S2→S3: User reviews/edits Categories_DB → Setup_Step_3=TRUE
- Any→Any: User clicks "Dismiss Forever" → Banner_Dismissed=TRUE

UI Behavior:
- If Setup_Complete=FALSE: Show setup wizard
- If Banner_Dismissed=FALSE: Show hint banner
- If Dismiss_Forever=TRUE: Never show banner again
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Implementation risk without clear spec

---

### ISSUE-021 - MEDIUM - RAND()-Based IDs Not Unique
**Sheet:** Transaction_DB  
**Issue Type:** Formula Error / Data Integrity  
**Location:** Column L (ID)  

**Issue:** Transaction IDs generated using RAND() are not guaranteed unique:
```excel
L2: =TEXT(RAND()*1E15,"0")
```

RAND() generates pseudo-random numbers, but with 10,000 rows:
- Probability of collision: ~0.005% per transaction
- Over 10,000 transactions: ~50% chance of at least one duplicate
- Birthday paradox: sqrt(1E15) ≈ 31M, so 50% collision at ~55K entries

**Evidence:**
- RAND() is not cryptographically secure
- No duplicate detection in formula
- Spec requires "unique identifier" but doesn't enforce uniqueness

**Impact:**
- **Data integrity:** Duplicate IDs break lookups and relationships
- **Debt tracking:** Debt_Payments_DB references Transaction IDs (Phase 6)
- **Audit trail:** Cannot reliably trace transactions
- **Reports:** Dashboard/Budget may double-count or skip transactions

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Use sequential IDs (RECOMMENDED for formula-only)
```excel
L2: =IF(A2<>"", "TXN"&TEXT(ROW(),"00000"), "")
' Result: TXN00002, TXN00003, TXN00004
' Simple, unique, deterministic
```

Option 2: Use GUID (requires Excel 365 or add-in)
```excel
L2: =IF(A2<>"", TEXT(RAND(),"########-####-####-####-############"), "")
' Better format but still uses RAND (not truly unique)
```

Option 3: Concatenate multiple fields for pseudo-unique ID
```excel
L2: =TEXT(A2,"YYYYMMDD")&TEXT(J2,"HHMMSS")&TEXT(ROW(),"0000")
' Result: 20251011143045002
' Date + Time + Row = practically unique
```

Option 4: Accept VBA for true GUID
```vba
Function GenerateGUID() As String
    GenerateGUID = CreateObject("Scriptlet.TypeLib").GUID
End Function
```
But project is 100% formula-driven, so NOT viable.

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Risk increases with usage

---

### ISSUE-022 - MEDIUM - Account/From/To Column Usage Unclear
**Sheet:** Transaction_DB  
**Issue Type:** Missing Documentation  
**Location:** Columns G (Account), H (From), I (To)  

**Issue:** Spec defines three account-related columns but doesn't explain when to use each:
```
G: Account    | Text | Optional | "Source account"
H: From       | Text | Optional | "Transfer source"
I: To         | Text | Optional | "Transfer destination"
```

**Questions:**
- Regular expense (Type=Expense): Populate G (Account) or leave blank?
- Transfer (Type=Transfer): Use H+I only? Or also populate G?
- Is G redundant with H for non-transfers?
- If I pay from Checking, do I put "Checking" in G, H, or both?

**Evidence:**
- Sample data doesn't clarify (spec says "generate via formula")
- Quick Entry form (Phase 2) doesn't show Account/From/To fields for regular transactions
- Only Debt Payment and Add Debt forms mention "From Account"
- No validation rules for when columns must be populated

**Impact:**
- **Inconsistency:** Users/implementers may populate differently
- **Data quality:** Reports may miscount if some transactions use G, others use H
- **Debt tracking:** Debt payments need "From" account (Phase 6) - is this column H?
- **Future features:** Account balance tracking impossible without clear rules

**Recommendation:**
Add to spec:
```markdown
## Account Column Usage Rules

**Column G (Account): DEPRECATED - Remove from schema**
- Redundant with From/To columns
- Causes confusion

**Column H (From): Source account for ALL transactions**
- Expense: "Checking" (which account paid from)
- Income: "Employer" (who paid you)
- Transfer: "Checking" (moving money from)

**Column I (To): Destination account**
- Expense: Leave blank (money leaves system)
- Income: "Checking" (which account received)
- Transfer: "Savings" (moving money to)

**Validation:**
- Type=Transfer: From and To REQUIRED
- Type=Expense/Income: From recommended, To optional
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Affects data quality

### ISSUE-023 - MEDIUM - 10K Row Pre-Allocation Performance Impact
**Sheet:** Transaction_DB  
**Issue Type:** Performance Issue  
**Location:** Named ranges (A2:A10000, B2:B10000, etc.)  

**Issue:** Spec pre-allocates 10,000 rows for all named ranges:
```excel
Transaction_DB[Date] = Transaction_DB!$A$2:$A$10000
Transaction_DB[Amount] = Transaction_DB!$F$2:$F$10000
```

With only 30 sample transactions, formulas scan 9,970 empty rows.

**Evidence:**
- SUMIF, COUNTIF, FILTER all iterate through full range
- Dashboard formulas like `=SUMIF(Transaction_DB[Category], "Dining", Transaction_DB[Amount])` scan 10,000 rows
- Empty cells still processed (not null)
- Excel's internal optimization helps, but not for complex formulas

**Impact:**
- **Dashboard:** 7 charts * 12 categories * 10K rows = 840K calculations
- **Budget:** Real-time spending tracking scans 10K rows on every edit
- **Reports:** Monthly summaries scan 10K rows * 12 months = 120K checks
- **Acceptable until:** ~500 transactions, then noticeable slowdown
- **Problematic after:** ~2,000 transactions, significant lag

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Use dynamic named ranges (Excel 2016 compatible)
```excel
' Named Range: Transaction_DB[Date]
=OFFSET(Transaction_DB!$A$2, 0, 0, 
        COUNTA(Transaction_DB!$A$2:$A$10000), 1)
' Expands to only filled rows
```
Pros: Auto-adjusts, faster
Cons: Volatile (OFFSET recalculates often)

Option 2: Use Table structure
```excel
' Convert Transaction_DB range A1:L10000 to Excel Table
' Named ranges become:
Transaction_DB[Date] (auto-managed by Excel)
```
Pros: Dynamic, built-in, Excel optimizes
Cons: Harder to hide/protect, changes interaction model

Option 3: Reduce pre-allocation to 1,000 rows
```excel
Transaction_DB[Date] = Transaction_DB!$A$2:$A$1001
```
Pros: 10x performance improvement
Cons: Need to extend manually when reaching 1,000 transactions

Option 4: Use separate "Archive" sheet after 1 year
- Keep current year in Transaction_DB (max 365 transactions)
- Move older transactions to Transaction_Archive
- Dashboard shows current year by default
- "View All Time" option merges both sheets

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Becomes HIGH after ~2,000 transactions

---

### ISSUE-026 - MEDIUM - TAB/ENTER Navigation Not Formula-Driven
**Sheet:** Quick Entry  
**Issue Type:** UX Problem / Misleading Documentation  
**Location:** Row 3 instructions, A12 save button  

**Issue:** Instructions say "Press ENTER on last field to save" but this isn't possible with formulas only:
```
A3: "💡 Use TAB to move between fields | Press ENTER on last field to save"
```

**Evidence:**
- TAB navigation: Built into Excel (no formula needed) ✓
- ENTER trigger: Requires VBA event handler OR user must click A12 manually ✗
- Project constraint: 100% formula-driven (no VBA)

**Impact:**
- **Misleading:** User presses ENTER, nothing happens
- **Frustration:** User doesn't understand why save doesn't trigger
- **Manual workaround:** User must click Save button with mouse

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Update instructions
```
A3: "💡 Use TAB to move between fields | Click 'Tap to Save' button when ready"
```

Option 2: Accept VBA for ENTER handler
```vba
Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)
    If Target.Address = "$K$9" Then  ' Amount field
        If Target.Value <> "" Then
            Application.Run "TriggerSave"  ' Call save routine
        End If
    End If
End Sub
```
But violates 100% formula-driven requirement.

Option 3: Remove ENTER trigger entirely
- Accept click-only save
- Update Acceptance Test #23 (currently tests ENTER trigger)

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Functional but misleading

---

### ISSUE-027 - MEDIUM - Auto-Clear Formula Pattern Impossible
**Sheet:** Quick Entry  
**Issue Type:** Formula Error / Architecture Flaw  
**Location:** Form input fields (A9, C9, E9, H9, K9)  

**Issue:** Spec says form fields should auto-clear after save using:
```excel
=IF(Z3, "", [User_Input])
```

But if the cell CONTAINS a formula, where does [User_Input] come from? Users can't type into a formula cell.

**Evidence:**
- Excel cells are either:
  - **Value cells:** User can type, no formula
  - **Formula cells:** Display calculation result, user can't type
- Can't be both simultaneously
- Spec shows formulas in input cells, making them read-only

**Impact:**
- **Critical UX break:** User cannot type into form fields
- **Blocking:** Form is completely non-functional
- **Spec flaw:** Auto-clear pattern requires VBA or manual delete

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Separate input and display cells (RECOMMENDED)
```
A9: [Input cell - no formula, user types here]
A8: =IF(Z3, "", A9)  [Hidden or display cell with auto-clear formula]
```
Forms show A8 (auto-clears), user types in A9 (hidden)

Option 2: No auto-clear - user manually deletes
```
A9: [Input cell - user types, manually clears for next entry]
```
Simpler, but less polished UX

Option 3: Use VBA for auto-clear
```vba
Private Sub TriggerSave()
    ' Save transaction...
    Range("A9,C9,E9,H9,K9").ClearContents  ' Auto-clear
End Sub
```
Violates formula-only requirement

Option 4: Make fields calculate from hidden row
```
A9: =A8  [Display cell - shows A8]
A8: [Hidden input cell - user types here, has auto-clear formula]
```
Still requires A8 to be input cell, same problem

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Form cannot function as specified

---

### ISSUE-028 - MEDIUM - Status Cell 3-Second Auto-Clear Uses Volatile Function
**Sheet:** Quick Entry  
**Issue Type:** Performance Issue / Formula Design  
**Location:** A13 (Status cell)  

**Issue:** Status message auto-clears after 3 seconds using:
```excel
A13: =IF(NOW()-Z4 < TIME(0,0,3),
        "✅ Saved to " & TEXT(QE_Date,"MMM YYYY") & " - " & QE_Category,
        "")
```

NOW() is volatile - recalculates on EVERY workbook change.

**Evidence:**
- NOW() doesn't count real-time seconds, only recalculates when:
  - User edits any cell
  - Workbook opens
  - Manual recalc (F9)
- If user saves transaction then doesn't touch workbook, status stays visible forever
- If user edits another cell immediately, status might clear before 3 seconds
- Unpredictable behavior

**Impact:**
- **Minor UX issue:** Status message timing inconsistent
- **Performance:** Adds another volatile formula to workbook
- **Not critical:** Status still displays, just doesn't auto-clear reliably

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Remove auto-clear (RECOMMENDED)
```excel
A13: =IF(Z4<>"",
        "✅ Saved to " & TEXT(QE_Date,"MMM YYYY") & " - " & QE_Category,
        "")
```
Status shows after save, clears on next save. Simple, predictable.

Option 2: Accept volatile behavior
- Document: "Status clears after ~3 seconds or next workbook interaction"
- User won't notice timing issues in practice

Option 3: Use VBA timer (violates formula-only)
```vba
Application.OnTime Now + TimeValue("00:00:03"), "ClearStatus"
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Works but unreliably

---

### ISSUE-029 - MEDIUM - Recent Transactions Flash Highlight Volatile
**Sheet:** Quick Entry  
**Issue Type:** Performance Issue / Visual Design  
**Location:** Rows 53-102 (Recent Transactions table)  

**Issue:** Conditional formatting for "recently added" uses:
```excel
=(NOW() - INDEX([TimestampColumn], ROW()-52)) < TIME(0,0,2)
```

NOW() causes constant recalculation and flickering.

**Evidence:**
- Same volatility issue as ISSUE-028
- 50 rows * volatile conditional format = 50 NOW() calculations
- Combined with ISSUE-028 and ISSUE-019 volatile functions, workbook has excessive volatility
- Yellow flash won't time precisely - depends on recalculation events

**Impact:**
- **Visual:** Flash may flicker or appear at wrong times
- **Performance:** Adds 50 volatile checks to workbook
- **Not critical:** Feature is cosmetic (nice-to-have)

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Remove flash feature (RECOMMENDED)
```
Conditional Formatting:
- Income rows: Lt Green background (static)
- Expense rows: Alternating White/Lt Blue (static)
```
Clean, simple, no volatility

Option 2: Flash only the top row (most recent)
```excel
' Conditional format for row 53 only:
=(NOW() - Z4) < TIME(0,0,2)
```
Reduces from 50 to 1 volatile check

Option 3: Use different highlight method
```excel
' Status cell Z5 tracks "last saved row"
' Conditional format:
=ROW() = Z5
```
Highlight persists until next save (no time-based fade)

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Cosmetic but impacts performance

---

### ISSUE-030 - MEDIUM - Three Forms on One Sheet Creates UX Confusion
**Sheet:** Quick Entry  
**Issue Type:** UX Problem  
**Location:** Entire sheet layout  

**Issue:** Spec places three separate forms on one sheet:
1. Regular transaction entry (rows 8-13)
2. Pay Debt form (rows 22-35)
3. Add New Debt form (rows 37-50)

Each has its own "Tap to Save" button. User sees three forms, three save buttons.

**Evidence:**
- Forms are always visible (not hidden by default)
- No indication of which form to use when
- Spec says "Always Visible" for debt forms
- New users will be confused by purpose of each form

**Impact:**
- **Confusion:** Which form do I use for a grocery expense?
- **Errors:** User might accidentally click wrong save button
- **Clutter:** 3 forms + 50-row table = lots of scrolling
- **Learning curve:** Need to understand difference between forms

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Separate sheets (RECOMMENDED)
- Quick Entry sheet: Transaction form + Recent Transactions only
- Debt Management sheet: Pay Debt + Add Debt forms
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Matches user mental model

Option 2: Use show/hide buttons
```
Row 20: [▼ Show Debt Payment Form] button
  Rows 22-35: Hidden by default
  Button changes to [▲ Hide Debt Payment Form] when visible
```
Keeps everything on one sheet but reduces clutter

Option 3: Use Excel Form Controls (radio buttons)
```
Row 7: ⚫ Regular Transaction  ⚪ Pay Debt  ⚪ Add Debt
  Show/hide relevant form based on selection
```
Clear selection, but requires VBA for show/hide logic

Option 4: Accept current design, add clear labels
```
Row 20: "━━━━━ DEBT MANAGEMENT FORMS (Optional) ━━━━━"
  Make it very clear these are separate, advanced features
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Functional but confusing

### ISSUE-008 - MEDIUM - Named Range Size Mismatch
**Sheet:** Categories_DB  
**Issue Type:** Design Mismatch  
**Location:** Named Range Definitions  

**Issue:** The spec defines two different ranges for Categories_DB[Name]:
```excel
Categories_DB[Name] = Categories_DB!$A$2:$A$1000  (1000 rows)
Categories_List     = Categories_DB!$A$2:$A$31    (30 rows)
```

But constraint says "Max 30 categories total".

**Evidence:**
- Spec explicitly states: "Max 30 categories total"
- Implementation Checklist references Categories_DB[Name] but doesn't specify which range to use
- Two named ranges point to same data with different sizes

**Impact:**
- **Performance:** Formulas using Categories_DB[Name] scan 970 unnecessary empty rows
- **Validation:** Inconsistent - which limit is enforced? 30 or 1000?
- **Confusion:** Two ranges for identical data creates ambiguity
- **Dropdown lists:** Categories_DB[Name] used in dropdowns will show 1000 blank entries

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Use the 30-row limit consistently
```excel
Categories_DB[Name] = Categories_DB!$A$2:$A$31
```
Remove Categories_List (redundant).

Option 2: Use dynamic range (Excel 365+)
```excel
Categories_DB[Name] = OFFSET(Categories_DB!$A$2, 0, 0, COUNTA(Categories_DB!$A$2:$A$1000), 1)
```
But this won't work for Excel 2016 (compatibility target).

Option 3: Keep 1000-row range, remove 30-category limit
- Update spec to say "Unlimited categories"
- Remove max 30 constraint from validation

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Affects performance and validation consistency

### ISSUE-036 - MEDIUM - No Duplication Avoidance Guidance
**Sheet:** CSV Import  
**Issue Type:** Missing Documentation  
**Location:** Instructions / Duplicate detection  

**Issue:** No guidance on avoiding duplicate entries when user has already manually entered some transactions and then imports bank CSV that also includes those transactions.

**Evidence:**
Spec shows duplicate detection formula but no instructions on WHAT TO DO when duplicates detected

**Impact:**
- Data quality: Double-counted income/expenses
- Reports inaccurate: Budget shows 2x actual spending
- User confusion: "Why is my income showing $8400 instead of $4200?"

**Recommendation:**
Add comprehensive duplication avoidance guide to CSV Import Instructions section

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Affects data quality

---

### ISSUE-037 - MEDIUM - Import Destination Unclear
**Sheet:** CSV Import  
**Issue Type:** Missing Documentation  
**Location:** Import workflow  

**Issue:** Specification implies CSV data imports to Transaction_DB but never explicitly states this. User might be confused about where imported data goes.

**Evidence:**
No confirmation message like "47 transactions imported to Transaction_DB"

**Impact:**
- User confusion: "Where did my data go?"
- Verification difficulty: User can't confirm import succeeded

**Recommendation:**
Add clear labeling: [📥 Import Selected to Transaction Log]
Add status message: "✅ 47 transactions imported to Transaction Log"

**Priority:** MEDIUM - UX clarity issue

---

### ISSUE-038 - MEDIUM - No Row Limit Guidance
**Sheet:** CSV Import  
**Issue Type:** Missing Documentation  
**Location:** Instructions / Paste area  

**Issue:** No documentation on how many rows users can paste. Is it 100? 500? 1000? 10,000?

**Evidence:**
Spec doesn't specify paste area size or user-facing guidance

**Impact:**
- User uncertainty: "Can I paste my full year of transactions (2000 rows)?"
- Performance issues: User pastes 5000 rows, Excel freezes (ISSUE-035)
- Support burden: Users will ask "What's the limit?"

**Recommendation:**
Add clear capacity guidance (500 rows recommended, 1000 maximum)

**Priority:** MEDIUM - User guidance needed

---

### ISSUE-039 - MEDIUM - No 5K Row Capacity Testing
**Sheet:** CSV Import  
**Issue Type:** Missing Documentation / Testing Gap  
**Location:** Performance specs  

**Issue:** No testing or documentation on whether system can handle 5000-row CSV imports.

**Evidence:**
No test results documented in any phase, no capacity limits stated in specs

**Impact:**
- Unknown capacity: Can't promise users "Works with 5000 transactions"
- Risk of failure: User imports 5000 rows, Excel crashes, data lost

**Recommendation:**
Run capacity testing protocol (100, 500, 1000, 5000 rows) and document results

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Must define capacity limits

---

### ISSUE-040 - MEDIUM - Missing Import Confirmation/Summary
**Sheet:** CSV Import  
**Issue Type:** Missing Feature  
**Location:** Import completion feedback  

**Issue:** After import completes, no summary showing what was imported, what was skipped, or any errors.

**Evidence:**
Spec shows Preview table but no post-import summary

**Impact:**
- Uncertainty: "Did all my transactions import?"
- Missed issues: User doesn't know 3 duplicates were skipped

**Recommendation:**
Add import summary cell with counts (imported, duplicates skipped, needs categorization)

**Priority:** MEDIUM - UX feedback essential

---

### ISSUE-045 - MEDIUM - TYPE DELETE Confirmation Pattern Implementation Unclear
**Sheet:** Settings Sheet  
**Issue Type:** Missing Documentation  
**Location:** Delete confirmations (A81, A87)  

**Issue:** Spec shows "Type DELETE to confirm" and "Type RESET to confirm" patterns but doesn't explain formula implementation:

**Expected Flow:**
1. User types "DELETE" in B81
2. Formula validates: =EXACT(B81, "DELETE")
3. [Yes, Delete] button becomes active? → How?
4. User clicks button → How detect click? (no VBA)
5. Action executes → How trigger?

**Evidence:**
- Validation formula is simple: `=EXACT(B81, "DELETE")`
- Button state change requires conditional formatting (OK)
- But click detection still needs VBA or Save Cell pattern
- Spec doesn't explain full implementation

**Impact:**
- **Implementer confusion:** How to build this pattern?
- **Inconsistent implementation:** Different devs might implement differently
- **Safety concern:** If not implemented correctly, dangerous actions might execute without confirmation

**Recommendation:**
Document complete pattern:
```markdown
## TYPE DELETE Confirmation Pattern

**Input Cell (B81):**
User types confirmation text

**Validation Cell (C81):**
=EXACT(B81, "DELETE")

**Button Cell (A82):**
Conditional formatting:
- If C81=TRUE: Navy background (active)
- If C81=FALSE: Lt Gray background (disabled)

**Trigger Cell (Z81):**
=IF(AND(C81=TRUE, B82<>B82_previous), TRUE, FALSE)
(Detects when user types in B82 after DELETE validated)

**Action Implementation:**
When Z81=TRUE:
- Settings_DB!Sample_Data_Active = FALSE
- Transaction_DB rows where Sample=TRUE → Delete
- Clear B81 and B82
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Safety pattern needs clear documentation

### ISSUE-046 - MEDIUM - Emoji Picker Doesn't Exist in Excel
**Sheet:** Settings Sheet  
**Issue Type:** Feature Limitation  
**Location:** A54 Icon field in Add Category form  

**Issue:** Spec shows "Icon: [🏠 ▼] (emoji picker - optional)" but Excel has no built-in emoji picker:
- Windows: Win + . opens emoji panel (OS-level, not Excel)
- Mac: Cmd + Ctrl + Space opens emoji viewer (OS-level)
- No Excel dropdown for emojis
- No formula to generate emoji picker

**Evidence:**
- Excel dropdowns (Data Validation) only support text lists
- Cannot display emoji characters in dropdown list reliably
- Emoji rendering varies by OS (Windows vs Mac vs mobile)

**Impact:**
- **Minor:** User can still enter emoji manually
- **UX inconsistency:** Spec shows dropdown, reality is manual entry
- **Cross-platform:** Emoji may not render identically

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Remove emoji dropdown
```
A54: Icon: [🏠____] (Type emoji or leave blank)
```
User copies emoji from elsewhere or uses keyboard shortcut

Option 2: Provide emoji list in instructions
```
Common emojis:
🏠 Housing  🛒 Groceries  🍽️ Dining  🚗 Transport
💊 Healthcare  🎬 Entertainment  🛍️ Shopping  💰 Income
💳 Savings  ↔️ Transfer

Copy and paste into Icon field.
```

Option 3: Use text labels instead
```
A54: Icon: [Housing ▼]
```
Dropdown of text labels: Housing, Groceries, Dining, Transport, etc.
No emojis, clearer cross-platform

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Spec promises feature that doesn't exist

---

### ISSUE-047 - MEDIUM - Category Count Formula Missing
**Sheet:** Settings Sheet  
**Issue Type:** Missing Formula  
**Location:** A19 "Current Categories: 12/30"  

**Issue:** Spec shows static text "Current Categories: 12/30" but this should be dynamic formula:

**Should be:**
```excel
A19: ="Current Categories: " & COUNTA(Categories_DB[Name]) & "/30"
```

Or if using Active_Categories only:
```excel
A19: ="Current Categories: " & COUNTA(Active_Categories) & "/30"
```

**Evidence:**
- Spec shows 12/30 as example
- As user adds categories, count should update
- 12 is the count of sample categories from Phase 1
- Max is 30 per Categories_DB spec

**Impact:**
- **Minor:** Count doesn't update as categories added
- **User confusion:** Sees 12/30 even after adding category (now 13 total)

**Recommendation:**
Add formula to spec:
```markdown
**A19: Category Counter**
```excel
="Current Categories: " & 
 COUNTIF(Categories_DB[Status], "Active") & "/30"
```
Updates dynamically as categories added/deleted.
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Missing dynamic formula

---

### ISSUE-048 - MEDIUM - Color Indicator Dot Implementation Unclear
**Sheet:** Settings Sheet  
**Issue Type:** Missing Documentation  
**Location:** A37-A45 Category list visual design  

**Issue:** Spec says "color indicator dot (left of name)" but doesn't explain implementation:
- Unicode colored circles don't exist (●  is black only)
- Emoji circles don't match category colors (🔴🟠🟡 limited palette)
- Must use cell background color or conditional formatting

**Evidence:**
Category list layout from spec:
```
Row 37: Housing        | Needs    | [Rename] [Delete]
```

Spec says: "Category names: 11pt Regular Black" and "color indicator dot (left of name)"

Possible implementations:
1. **Thin column A with colored background**
   - Column A width: 10px
   - Background = Categories_DB[Color] for that row
   - Category name in column B

2. **Conditional formatting**
   - Cell A37 contains full text "Housing"
   - Conditional format: Background = INDEX(Categories_DB[Color], MATCH(A37, Categories_DB[Name], 0))

3. **Unicode circle + color**
   - Cell A37: ="● " & Category_Name
   - Font color of ● = category color
   - But Excel formulas can't set font color dynamically

**Impact:**
- **Implementer confusion:** How to create colored dots?
- **Visual inconsistency:** Different implementations look different

**Recommendation:**
Specify exact method:
```markdown
**Color Indicator Implementation:**

Method: Thin colored column
- Column A: 12px wide, contains space " "
- Conditional formatting on A37:
  - Formula: =A37<>""
  - Format: Background color = INDEX(Categories_DB[Color], ROW()-36)
- Column B: Category name text
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Missing visual implementation detail

---

### ISSUE-095 - MEDIUM - Month_ID Auto-Formula in Database
**Sheet:** Debt_DB  
**Issue Type:** Formula Design Pattern  
**Location:** Column C (Month_ID)  

**Issue:** Spec shows Month_ID as auto-formula in database:
```excel
C2: =TEXT(H2,"YYYY-MM")
```

This is the same pattern as Transaction_DB (ISSUE-024) but creates performance concerns when formulas exist in database sheets.

**Evidence:**
- 50 pre-allocated rows = 50 TEXT formula calculations
- Every time Start_Date changes, Month_ID recalculates
- Acceptable overhead but inconsistent with "pure data" best practice

**Impact:**
- **Minor performance**: 50 TEXT formulas negligible
- **Pattern consistency**: Transaction_DB has same issue
- **Not blocking**: Works but not optimal

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Accept formula pattern (RECOMMENDED for consistency with Transaction_DB)
Option 2: Make Month_ID manual entry (simpler but error-prone)

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Works but worth documenting

---

### ISSUE-098 - MEDIUM - ID Column Uses RAND() (Not Unique)
**Sheet:** Debt_DB  
**Issue Type:** Data Integrity  
**Location:** Column A (ID)  

**Issue:** Debt IDs likely use RAND()-based generation (same as Transaction_DB ISSUE-021):
```excel
A2: =TEXT(RAND()*1E15,"0")
```

RAND() not guaranteed unique - collision risk exists.

**Evidence:**
- Same pattern as Transaction_DB
- With 50 debts, low collision risk but not zero
- Debt_Payments_DB references these IDs - duplicates break linkage

**Impact:**
- Data integrity risk
- Payment history may link to wrong debt
- Balance calculations incorrect

**Recommendation:**
Use sequential IDs instead:
```excel
A2: =IF(B2<>"", "DEBT"&TEXT(ROW(),"00"), "")
' Result: DEBT02, DEBT03, DEBT04
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Low risk but not guaranteed unique

---

### ISSUE-099 - MEDIUM - Last_Pay_Date Formula Undefined
**Sheet:** Debt_DB  
**Issue Type:** Missing Formula  
**Location:** Column J (Last_Pay_Date)  

**Issue:** Spec shows Last_Pay_Date column but doesn't explain how it's populated:
- Manual entry?
- Auto-calculated from MAX(Debt_Payments_DB[Date])?
- Updated when Quick Entry saves payment?

**Evidence:**
No formula provided in spec for this column.

**Impact:**
- Implementation uncertainty
- If formula: another MAXIFS scan of Debt_Payments_DB (performance)
- If manual: easy to forget updating

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Auto-calculate (RECOMMENDED)
```excel
J2: =IFERROR(MAXIFS(Debt_Payments_DB[Date],
                     Debt_Payments_DB[Debt_ID],
                     A2), "")
```

Option 2: Make read-only display in Debt sheet
- Debt_DB[Last_Pay_Date] = blank
- Debt sheet shows: =MAXIFS(Debt_Payments_DB[Date], ...)

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Functional uncertainty

---

### ISSUE-100 - MEDIUM - Created Column Uses NOW() (Volatile)
**Sheet:** Debt_DB  
**Issue Type:** Performance Issue  
**Location:** Column K (Created)  

**Issue:** Created column likely uses NOW() or TODAY():
```excel
K2: =IF(B2<>"", IF(K2="", NOW(), K2), "")
```

Circular reference AND volatile function (same pattern as ISSUE-002, ISSUE-011).

**Evidence:**
- Same pattern as Categories_DB and Settings_DB
- 50 rows with NOW() = 50 volatile cells
- Acceptable overhead but adds to workbook volatility total

**Impact:**
- Minor performance impact (50 cells)
- Circular reference won't work
- Combined with other volatile formulas, compounds issue

**Recommendation:**
Remove auto-fill formula:
```excel
K2: Manual entry or blank
```
Or use external trigger:
```excel
K2: =IF(B2<>"", Quick_Entry!Z_Timestamp, "")
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Pattern consistency

---

### ISSUE-101 - MEDIUM - Status Validation List Undefined
**Sheet:** Debt_DB  
**Issue Type:** Missing Specification  
**Location:** Column I (Status)  

**Issue:** Status column should have dropdown validation (Active/Paid Off/Archived) but spec doesn't show this:

**Expected:**
```excel
Data Validation on I2:I51
List: Active, Paid Off, Archived
```

**Evidence:**
Spec shows Status example values but no validation rule.

**Impact:**
- User might type "active" (lowercase) - breaks filtering
- Typos possible: "Actve", "Achived"
- Formula errors if Status values inconsistent

**Recommendation:**
Add dropdown validation:
```excel
Column I: List = Active, Paid Off, Archived
Error Alert: "Status must be Active, Paid Off, or Archived"
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Data quality issue

---

### ISSUE-105 - MEDIUM - 500-Row Pre-Allocation Excessive
**Sheet:** Debt_Payments_DB  
**Issue Type:** Performance / Design Decision  
**Location:** Row allocation (2-501)  

**Issue:** Spec pre-allocates 500 rows for debt payments:
```excel
Debt_Payments_DB[Amount] = $E$2:$E$500
```

With 2 debts and monthly payments, 500 rows = 20+ years of payment history.

**Evidence:**
- Sample data: 8 payments
- Typical usage: 2-5 debts × 12 payments/year = 24-60 payments/year
- 500 rows = 8-20 years of data
- Most users need 100-200 rows max

**Impact:**
- Minor performance: SUMIFS/MAXIFS scan 450+ empty rows
- Debt_DB Curr_Bal formula scans all 500 rows per debt
- With 10 debts, that's 5,000 cell checks

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Reduce to 200 rows (still 3-8 years of history)
Option 2: Keep 500 rows for long-term users
Option 3: Use dynamic range

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Works but slightly inefficient

---

### ISSUE-106 - MEDIUM - Month_ID Auto-Formula Pattern (Consistency)
**Sheet:** Debt_Payments_DB  
**Issue Type:** Formula Design Pattern  
**Location:** Column D (Month_ID)  

**Issue:** Month_ID uses auto-formula:
```excel
D2: =TEXT(C2,"YYYY-MM")
```

500 rows = 500 TEXT formula calculations (same pattern as Transaction_DB, Debt_DB).

**Evidence:**
- Consistent with Transaction_DB ISSUE-024, Debt_DB ISSUE-095
- Acceptable overhead but compounds across sheets
- Total volatile/formula cells increasing

**Impact:**
- Minor: 500 TEXT formulas negligible individually
- Pattern consistency: Same approach across all payment/transaction sheets
- Not blocking: Works fine

**Recommendation:**
Accept pattern for consistency across all DB sheets.

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Pattern documentation

---

### ISSUE-107 - MEDIUM - ID Column Uses RAND() (Not Unique)
**Sheet:** Debt_Payments_DB  
**Issue Type:** Data Integrity  
**Location:** Column A (ID)  

**Issue:** Payment IDs likely use RAND()-based generation:
```excel
A2: =TEXT(RAND()*1E15,"0")
```

Same issue as Transaction_DB (ISSUE-021), Debt_DB (ISSUE-098).

**Evidence:**
- Pattern repeats across all DB sheets
- With 500 payments, higher collision risk than Debt_DB (50 rows)
- Transaction_ID column (G) references Transaction_DB - if both use RAND, double collision risk

**Impact:**
- Data integrity risk
- Payment history may have duplicate IDs
- Transaction linkage breaks if duplicate ID

**Recommendation:**
Use sequential IDs:
```excel
A2: =IF(C2<>"", "DP"&TEXT(ROW(),"0000"), "")
' Result: DP0002, DP0003, DP0004
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Collision risk increases with usage

---

### ISSUE-110 - MEDIUM - No Payment Type/Method Column
**Sheet:** Debt_Payments_DB  
**Issue Type:** Missing Feature / Enhancement  
**Location:** Missing column for payment method  

**Issue:** No column to track HOW payment was made:
- Bank transfer?
- Check?
- Auto-pay?
- Manual?

This is useful for:
- Tracking which payments are automatic (budget planning)
- Identifying payment methods for tax purposes
- Troubleshooting if payment fails

**Evidence:**
From_Acct column (F) shows WHERE payment came from, but not HOW.

**Impact:**
- **Minor**: Nice-to-have, not critical
- **Reporting gap**: Can't analyze payment methods
- **User insight**: Can't see which debts are on auto-pay

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Add Payment_Method column (H)
```excel
Column H: Payment_Method
Options: Manual, Auto-Pay, Bank Transfer, Check
Data Validation: Dropdown list
```

Option 2: Accept limitation
- Keep simple 7-column schema
- Document as future enhancement

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Enhancement, not blocker

---

### ISSUE-113 - MEDIUM - No Timestamp Column
**Sheet:** Debt_Payments_DB  
**Issue Type:** Missing Feature / Audit Trail  
**Location:** Missing Timestamp column  

**Issue:** Transaction_DB has Timestamp column (J) showing when entry created, but Debt_Payments_DB doesn't.

Useful for:
- Audit trail (when was payment logged?)
- Troubleshooting (did payment save correctly?)
- Sorting by creation order (vs Date order)

**Evidence:**
Transaction_DB Column J: Timestamp (NOW() formula).
Debt_Payments_DB: No equivalent.

**Impact:**
- **Audit gap**: Can't verify when payment was logged
- **Troubleshooting**: Hard to diagnose save issues
- **Minor**: Date column (C) partially covers this

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Add Timestamp column (H or after last column)
```excel
Column H: Timestamp
Formula: =NOW() (when payment logged)
```

Option 2: Accept Date as sufficient
- Date shows payment date (user input)
- Timestamp would show entry date (system generated)
- Keep schema simple

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Useful for audit trail

---

## 🟢 LOW Issues (Count: 7)

*Cosmetic, nice-to-haves, future enhancements*

### ISSUE-006 - LOW - 15-Color Palette Not Defined
**Sheet:** Categories_DB  
**Issue Type:** Missing Feature  
**Location:** Column C (Color) validation  

**Issue:** Spec mentions "15-color palette" multiple times but never defines which 15 colors. The sample data shows hex codes but no master palette list exists.

**Evidence:**
- Spec says: "List: 15 colors" but doesn't list them
- Sample data uses: #1A2B4A, #AFB42B, #5D4037, etc.
- No validation list provided

**Impact:**
- Minor: Implementer must guess or define palette themselves
- Inconsistent colors possible if different implementers choose different palettes
- Missing from Design System spec check

**Recommendation:**
Add to Phase_01 or Design_System doc:
```
Category Color Palette (15 colors):
1. Navy #1A2B4A
2. Gold #D4AF37  
3. Green #2E7D32
4. Red #C62828
5. Orange #F57C00
6. Blue #1976D2
7. Purple #7B1FA2
8. Teal #00897B
9. Pink #C2185B
10. Brown #5D4037
11. Indigo #303F9F
12. Cyan #0097A7
13. Lime #AFB42B
14. Amber #FFA000
15. Gray #757575
```

**Priority:** LOW - Workaround easy (just pick 15 colors)

---

### ISSUE-007 - LOW - Sample Data Count Mismatch
**Sheet:** Keywords_DB  
**Issue Type:** Minor Inconsistency  
**Location:** Sample data list  

**Issue:** Spec says "30 common keywords" but the sample data table shows 30 rows with some potentially missing.

Counting the sample: starbucks, dunkin, mcdonalds, chipotle, restaurant, cafe, safeway, walmart, target, grocery, whole foods, shell, chevron, gas, uber, lyft, netflix, spotify, hulu, amazon prime, rent, mortgage, electric, water, internet, cvs, walgreens, pharmacy, salary, paycheck = exactly 30 ✓

Actually, this is correct. Marking as LOW just to document verification.

**Evidence:** Count verified = 30

**Impact:** None - count is accurate

**Recommendation:** No action needed. This was a verification checkpoint.

**Priority:** LOW - Not actually an issue

---

### ISSUE-015 - LOW - Incomplete Named Range List
**Sheet:** Settings_DB  
**Issue Type:** Documentation Incomplete  
**Location:** Named Ranges section  

**Issue:** Spec says "Create similar [named ranges] for all 20 settings" but only shows 6 examples:
```
Currency_Symbol = Settings_DB!$B$2
Date_Format = Settings_DB!$B$3
Period_Selected = Settings_DB!$B$8
Monthly_Income = Settings_DB!$B$6
Budget_Method = Settings_DB!$B$7
Setup_Complete = Settings_DB!$B$9
```

**Evidence:**
- 20 settings defined
- Only 6 have named range examples
- Unclear if ALL 20 should get named ranges or just these 6

**Impact:**
- **Minor:** Inconsistent implementation
- **Confusion:** Which settings need named ranges?
- **Maintenance:** If settings expand to 25, do we add 5 more named ranges?

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: List all 20 named ranges explicitly
```
Currency_Symbol = Settings_DB!$B$2
Currency_Code = Settings_DB!$B$3
Date_Format = Settings_DB!$B$4
... (17 more)
```
No ambiguity.

Option 2: Clarify strategy
```markdown
## Named Range Strategy
Only create named ranges for settings that are:
1. Referenced by formulas (Currency_Symbol, Period_Selected)
2. Used in multiple sheets (Monthly_Income, Budget_Method)

Settings used only in Settings sheet UI:
- Use VLOOKUP helper function instead
- No named range needed
```

Option 3: Use table structure
- Convert Settings_DB to Excel Table
- Reference as `Settings_DB[@Setting_Value]`
- Auto-expands with new settings

**Priority:** LOW - Workaround exists (VLOOKUP)

---

### ISSUE-016 - LOW - Missing Validation Specs
**Sheet:** Settings_DB  
**Issue Type:** Documentation Incomplete  
**Location:** Data Validation section  

**Issue:** Spec says "Data type validation per setting" but doesn't detail which settings need dropdowns, min/max limits, or format rules.

**Evidence:**
Spec mentions validation generically:
```
Settings_DB: Data type validation per setting
```

But doesn't specify:
- Period_Selected: Dropdown of Week/Month/Quarter/Year?
- Budget_Method: Dropdown of "50/30/20 Auto"/"Zero-Based"/"Custom %"?
- Week_Start: Dropdown of Sunday/Monday/.../Saturday?
- Assumed_Investment_Return: Min=0, Max=20 (reasonable bounds)?
- Week_Start_Offset: Min=1, Max=7?

**Impact:**
- **Minor:** Implementer must guess validation rules
- **Inconsistency:** Different devs might add different validations
- **User experience:** No input guidance without dropdowns

**Recommendation:**
Add validation matrix to spec:
```markdown
| Setting | Validation Rule | Error Message |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Currency_Symbol | Text, max 3 chars | "Use standard currency symbols" |
| Date_Format | Dropdown: MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD | "Select date format" |
| Week_Start | Dropdown: Sunday, Monday | "Select week start day" |
| Period_Selected | Dropdown: Week, Month, Quarter, Year | "Select period" |
| Budget_Method | Dropdown: 50/30/20 Auto, Zero-Based, Custom % | "Select budget method" |
| Monthly_Income | Number >= 0 | "Income must be positive" |
| Assumed_Investment_Return | Number, 0-20 | "Return must be 0-20%" |
| Week_Start_Offset | Number, 1-7 | "Offset must be 1-7" |
```

**Priority:** LOW - Functional without, but improves UX

---

### ISSUE-017 - LOW - VLOOKUP Helper Not Used
**Sheet:** Settings_DB  
**Issue Type:** Documentation Inconsistency  
**Location:** Helper Function section  

**Issue:** Spec shows a VLOOKUP helper function pattern:
```excel
=VLOOKUP("Currency_Symbol", Settings_DB!$A:$B, 2, FALSE)
```

But the actual implementation uses named ranges instead:
```excel
Currency_Symbol = Settings_DB!$B$2
' Then formulas use: =Currency_Symbol
```

No sheet in any phase actually uses the VLOOKUP pattern.

**Evidence:**
- Phase 2-8 specs all reference named ranges (Currency_Symbol, Period_Selected)
- No formula uses VLOOKUP(Settings_DB!$A:$B,...)
- VLOOKUP pattern appears only in Phase 1 spec, unused elsewhere

**Impact:**
- **None:** Just documentation artifact
- **Confusion:** Developer might implement both patterns
- **Maintenance:** Inconsistent approaches in codebase

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Remove VLOOKUP helper from spec
- Consolidate on named ranges only
- Simpler, faster, clearer

Option 2: Document as alternative
```markdown
## Setting Access Patterns

Preferred: Named ranges (fastest)
=Currency_Symbol

Alternative: VLOOKUP (for dynamic keys)
=VLOOKUP(A1, Settings_DB!$A:$B, 2, FALSE)
Use when setting name comes from cell reference.
```

**Priority:** LOW - Documentation cleanup only

### ISSUE-102 - LOW - 50-Row Pre-Allocation May Be Excessive
**Sheet:** Debt_DB  
**Issue Type:** Performance / Design Decision  
**Location:** Row allocation (2-51)  

**Issue:** Spec pre-allocates 50 rows for debts:
```excel
Debt_DB[Name] = $B$2:$B$51
```

Most users have 2-10 debts. 50 seems excessive.

**Evidence:**
- Sample data shows 2 debts
- Most users have 3-8 debts (credit cards, student loans, car)
- 50 rows = formulas scan 40+ empty rows unnecessarily

**Impact:**
- Minor performance: SUMIFS scans empty rows
- Negligible: 50 rows very small
- File size: Minimal increase

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Reduce to 25 rows (still generous)
Option 2: Keep 50 rows (allows edge cases)
Option 3: Use dynamic range (COUNTA-based)

**Priority:** LOW - Works fine, just slightly inefficient

### ISSUE-111 - LOW - From_Acct Column Inconsistent with Transaction_DB
**Sheet:** Debt_Payments_DB  
**Issue Type:** Design Inconsistency  
**Location:** Column F (From_Acct)  

**Issue:** Debt_Payments_DB uses "From_Acct" but Transaction_DB has three account columns:
- Column G: Account (deprecated per ISSUE-022)
- Column H: From
- Column I: To

Inconsistent naming and unclear which Transaction_DB column should match From_Acct.

**Evidence:**
- Debt_Payments_DB: From_Acct
- Transaction_DB: Account, From, To
- Quick Entry Pay Debt form: "From Account" field

**Impact:**
- **Minor confusion**: Developer uncertainty
- **Data consistency**: Should From_Acct match Transaction_DB[From] or Transaction_DB[Account]?
- **Not blocking**: Doesn't break functionality

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Rename to "From" (match Transaction_DB column H)
```
Debt_Payments_DB Column F: From (not From_Acct)
Matches Transaction_DB[From]
```

Option 2: Keep as-is, document mapping
```
From_Acct → Stored in Transaction_DB[From] column
```

**Priority:** LOW - Naming consistency

---

### ISSUE-112 - LOW - No Soft Delete Support
**Sheet:** Debt_Payments_DB  
**Issue Type:** Missing Feature  
**Location:** No Deleted? column  

**Issue:** Transaction_DB has Deleted? column (K) for soft deletes, but Debt_Payments_DB doesn't.

If user accidentally logs wrong payment:
- In Transaction_DB: Can soft delete (set Deleted? = TRUE)
- In Debt_Payments_DB: Must hard delete (lose history) or manually correct

**Evidence:**
Transaction_DB has soft delete support (ISSUE-020 context).
Debt_Payments_DB schema has no equivalent.

**Impact:**
- **Minor**: Users can manually edit Amount to $0 as workaround
- **Audit trail**: Hard delete loses payment history
- **Consistency**: Different delete behavior between DB sheets

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Add Deleted? column (H)
```excel
Column H: Deleted? (Boolean)
Default: FALSE
Formulas: SUMIFS ignores rows where Deleted?=TRUE
```

Option 2: Accept limitation
- Keep simple schema
- Users edit Amount to $0 to "delete"

**Priority:** LOW - Nice-to-have, not critical

---

### ISSUE-024 - LOW - Month_ID Column Excellent Design But Undocumented
**Sheet:** Transaction_DB  
**Issue Type:** Missing Documentation (Positive Finding)  
**Location:** Column B (Month_ID)  

**Issue:** The Month_ID column is actually brilliant design for performance, but spec doesn't explain WHY it exists or how it benefits the system.

**Evidence:**
Spec shows:
```excel
B (Month_ID): TEXT | "2025-10" | Auto-formula
Formula: =TEXT(A2,"YYYY-MM")
```

But doesn't explain:
- Why not just use Date column directly?
- How does this improve performance?
- Which sheets/formulas use Month_ID?

**Why This is Good Design:**
1. **Fast filtering:** `=COUNTIF(Transaction_DB[Month_ID], "2025-10")` is 10x faster than date range checks
2. **Simple comparisons:** Text match vs date arithmetic
3. **Multi-year support:** Works seamlessly across year boundaries
4. **Dashboard optimization:** Period filter uses Month_ID instead of complex date logic
5. **Excel 2016 compatible:** No special date functions needed

**Impact:**
- **None negative:** Column works perfectly
- **Positive:** Performance boost for all period-filtered reports
- **Documentation gap:** Future maintainers won't understand the purpose

**Recommendation:**
Add to spec documentation:
```markdown
## Month_ID Column Design Pattern

**Purpose:** Fast period filtering without date arithmetic

**Formula:** `=TEXT(Date, "YYYY-MM")`  
**Example:** Oct 11, 2025 → "2025-10"

**Benefits:**
1. **10x faster filtering:** Text match vs date range calculation
2. **Simpler formulas:** `Month_ID = "2025-10"` vs `AND(Date >= DATE(2025,10,1), Date < DATE(2025,11,1))`
3. **Year-boundary safe:** Dec 2025 and Jan 2026 handled automatically
4. **Used by:** Dashboard charts, Budget period filter, Income YTD calculation

**Pattern Usage:**
```excel
' Instead of:
=SUMIFS(Amount, Date, ">="&StartDate, Date, "<"&EndDate)

' Use:
=SUMIF(Month_ID, "2025-10", Amount)
```

**Note:** This is a performance optimization pattern. Keep Month_ID in all transaction-like databases.
```

**Priority:** LOW - Documentation enhancement (not a bug)

### ISSUE-031 - LOW - Merge Cells Break Navigation
**Sheet:** Quick Entry  
**Issue Type:** UX Problem  
**Location:** Multiple merged regions  

**Issue:** Spec uses many merged cells:
- A1:W1 (Title)
- A3:W3 (Instructions)  
- E9:G9 (Description field)
- H9:I9 (Category field)
- A12:K12 (Save button)
- A13:K13 (Status cell)

**Evidence:**
- Merged cells disrupt Excel's natural grid navigation
- Arrow keys skip over merged areas unpredictably
- Hard to select/copy specific columns
- Cell references become ambiguous (A1 vs W1?)
- Copy/paste operations can fail or produce unexpected results

**Impact:**
- **Minor UX friction:** Navigation feels broken
- **Developer confusion:** Which cell reference to use?
- **Maintenance:** Harder to modify layout later
- **Not blocking:** Sheet still functions

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Use "Center Across Selection" instead of merge
- Select A1:W1
- Format Cells → Alignment → Horizontal: Center Across Selection
- Looks identical, doesn't actually merge cells
- Preserves navigation

Option 2: Accept merged cells but document clearly
- Add to spec: "Use A1 reference for merged region A1:W1"
- Warn about navigation issues

Option 3: Reduce merges to minimum
- Keep title merge (A1:W1) for visual impact
- Remove field merges (E9:G9) - just make column E wider
- Reduces navigation issues

**Priority:** LOW - Cosmetic/convenience issue

### ISSUE-032 - LOW - Freeze Panes Specification Incomplete  
**Sheet:** Quick Entry  
**Issue Type:** Missing Documentation  
**Location:** Freeze Panes setting  

**Issue:** Spec says "Freeze Panes: Row 6" but doesn't specify column freeze.

When user scrolls right to column Z (hidden helpers), title in column A disappears.
When user scrolls down past row 52, title in row 1 stays visible ✓ but form labels in row 8 disappear.

**Evidence:**
- Freeze Panes can freeze:
  - Rows only: Keeps top rows visible when scrolling down
  - Columns only: Keeps left columns visible when scrolling right
  - Both: Keeps top-left corner visible always (most common)
- "Freeze Row 6" is ambiguous

**Impact:**
- **Minor:** Horizontal scrolling loses context
- **Expected behavior:** Most sheets freeze at A7 (row AND column)
- **Not critical:** Most users won't scroll horizontally

**Recommendation:**
Clarify in spec:
```markdown
Freeze Panes: Cell A7
- Keeps rows 1-6 visible (title, instructions, form labels)
- Keeps column A visible when scrolling right
- Standard Excel practice
```

OR if truly only vertical freeze:
```markdown
Freeze Panes: Row 7 only (horizontal scroll allowed)
- User can scroll right through columns
- Top 6 rows always visible
```

**Priority:** LOW - Documentation clarity

### ISSUE-010 - LOW - Unused Default? Column
**Sheet:** Categories_DB  
**Issue Type:** Design Inefficiency  
**Location:** Column E (Default?)  

**Issue:** Column E "Default?" stores TRUE/FALSE for "Pre-loaded category?" but serves no functional purpose after initial setup.

**Evidence:**
- No formula in any phase references Categories_DB[Default?]
- No conditional logic uses this flag
- No user interface shows/hides based on this value
- Only purpose is historical tracking (was it pre-loaded or user-added?)

**Impact:**
- **Minor:** Wastes 1 column width (30 bytes per category)
- **Minimal:** No performance impact
- **Confusion:** Users may wonder why this field exists

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Remove column entirely
- Categories_DB becomes A-F (6 columns)
- Update all column references in specs
- Cleaner schema

Option 2: Make it functional
- Use Default?=TRUE to prevent deletion (protect system categories)
- Show in UI: "Cannot delete default category"
- Add validation in Settings sheet category management

Option 3: Keep as-is for audit trail
- Accept minor overhead for historical tracking
- Document purpose in Instructions sheet

**Priority:** LOW - Not broken, just inefficient

### ISSUE-009 - LOW - Unused Confidence Column
**Sheet:** Keywords_DB  
**Issue Type:** Missing Feature  
**Location:** Column C (Confidence)  

**Issue:** Keywords_DB has Confidence scores (0-100) but the CSV Import matching formula doesn't use them.

**Evidence:**
From Phase_01 spec:
```excel
=IFERROR(INDEX(Keywords_DB[Category],
               MATCH("*"&LOWER(Description)&"*", 
                     Keywords_DB[Keyword], 0)),
         "Uncategorized")
```
This formula returns the FIRST match found, not the HIGHEST confidence match.

**Impact:**
- **Minor:** Confidence data is unused (wasted storage)
- **Opportunity:** Could improve auto-categorization accuracy
- Example: "target" matches both "Target" (Shopping, 85) and "grocery" (Groceries, 90)
  - Current: Returns first match (might be wrong)
  - Better: Return highest confidence match

**Recommendation:**
Option 1: Use confidence in matching logic
```excel
=INDEX(Keywords_DB[Category], 
       MATCH(MAX(IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH(Keywords_DB[Keyword], LOWER(Description))),
                    Keywords_DB[Confidence], 0)),
             Keywords_DB[Confidence], 0))
```
(Array formula - may have performance implications)

Option 2: Remove Confidence column
- Keywords_DB becomes A-B (2 columns)
- Simpler schema
- Update all references

Option 3: Keep for future enhancement
- Document in spec: "Reserved for future use"
- Add to Phase 9 roadmap: "Smart categorization"

**Priority:** LOW - Not broken, just incomplete
