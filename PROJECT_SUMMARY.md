## Why This Product?

**The Problem:**  
Most spreadsheet-based finance trackers fail because they're either too basic (glorified calculators) or too complex (require hours to learn). Users abandon them within weeks because:
- Entry is tedious (1-2 minutes per transaction in basic spreadsheets)
- No clear insights or decision guidance
- Break on different platforms (macros don't work on Mac/mobile)
- Intimidating for non-experts

**Our Solution:**  
A **professional-grade personal finance workbook** that combines app-like simplicity with spreadsheet power. Built 100% with formulas (no VBA/macros), it works across Windows, Mac, web, and mobile (view-optimized) with **keyboard-optimized entry** (9 seconds with practice) and instant decision insights.

**Target Market:**
- Budget-conscious professionals ($40K-$100K income)
- Side hustlers tracking multiple income streams
- Couples managing joint finances
- Anyone frustrated with subscription apps but wants better than basic spreadsheets
- Users in corporate environments where macros are blocked
